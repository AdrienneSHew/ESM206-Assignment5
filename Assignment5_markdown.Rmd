#4. Multivariate Linear Regression Model 

facultysal_lm <- lm(Salary ~ Faculty_Rank + Discipline + Years_Since_PhD + Years_Faculty_Service + Sex, data = Faculty_sal)

summary(facultysal_lm)

# This initial model revealed that with every 1 year increase in teaching experience (service), salary is expected to decrease by ~ $490.00. This doesn't make a whole bunch of sense as more experience usually leads to an increase in pay. 

#Makes me think that there may be collinearity between both "years" variables

### Check for collinearity between service and years since PhD

faculty_coll <- cor(Faculty_sal$Years_Since_PhD, Faculty_sal$Years_Faculty_Service)

#Choosing to exclude this variable, because conceptually, how long an individual has been teaching seems like it would be more relevant and would include having a PhD. How long a person has had their PhD, would weigh less if they haven't also been teaching.
